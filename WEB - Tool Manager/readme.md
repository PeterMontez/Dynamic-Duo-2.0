# Web Application for a Tooling Storage System

Web application with the main goal of aiding people on the workshop to better keep up with the ever-changing position of their tools.


## About the project

Using EJS, JS and CSS, the application is very intuitive and simple to use, and alongside a RFID card reader allows the workers to remove or return tools to their correct cabinet and drawer.

Using mysql and sequelize to handle the data, the user can easily find the tool they want with very descriptive cards.
